# Financial transactions data analytics
Financial dataset for fraud detection, financial analysis and AI-powered banking solution.

## Overview
This repository showcases a comprehensive data analytics covering data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization using multiple tools and technologies. The project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in Python, R, SQL and BI tools.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze fraud transactions by clients, categories and card types for derive insights, financial planning with financial health indicators for customer segmentation for enhance decision making.

## Tools & Technologies
- **R** (base, dplyr) for data extraction and data transformation.<br>

- **Python** (pandas, sqlalchemy) for data transformation and database connection.<br>

- **MySQL** for database schema and populate tables.<br>

- **PowerBI** for data insights and interactive report.

## How to use this repository
1. **R analysis:** run the R scripts file (`clean_data.R`) in Rstudio to explore data for `users_data.csv` and `cards_data.csv`.<br>

2. **Python analysis:** run the python scripts file (`clean_data.py`) in Pycharm to explore data for `transactions_data.csv`, `frauds_data.json` and `mccs_data.json`.<br>

3. **SQL schema:** run the SQL scripts file (`create_database.sql`) in MySQL to create schema and populate tables for receive data.<br>

4. **Python to MySQL:** determine database config and run the python scripts file (`conn_database.py`) in Pycharm to input data to database.<br>

5. **BI dashboard:** open the BI report file (`fraud_report.pbix`) in Power BI to interact with objects visualizations and data insights.

## Discoveries & Key insights
1. **Fraud transactions:** discovered that fraudulent transactions for **0.15%** of all financial transactions, It's **1.47** million USD. The most frequently occurring fraudulent transactions were associated with **client ID 1102**, **department stores** and **debit card** when classified by client, category and card type respectively.<br>

2. **Customer segmentation:** discovered that in 2019, recent year analyzed, customer financial planning could be devided into 3 criteria based on financial health indicators. Among all customers, the **Fair** criteria had the highest proportion at **80.70%**, followed by **Excellent** at **13.15%**, and **Improve** at **6.15%** respectively.
